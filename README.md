# 100daysofcode
100 days of code challenge

This is my commitment on 10/01/2021 to code for at least 1 hour a day for 100 days
I'm not entirely sure how to link code in to GitHub yet
I will be working through Colt Steele's 'Web Developer Bootcamp' on UDemy
Once I understand better how to push requests to GitHub I'll do this so there is a record of the coding I've been doing for public and personal accountability!

GOOD LUCK ME!

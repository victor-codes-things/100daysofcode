   <p>HTML5 is not a version - it is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML.
    Also includes HTML5 and friends (a larger set of technologies that allows building
    of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications.)
   </p> 
   <p>There is a 'HTML standard' that is how browsers build the HTML based off the standard.</p>
   <p>You can find HTML standard here: <a href = "https://html.spec.whatwg.org">html.spec.whatwg.org</A></p>
    <h1>Block Elements</h1>
    <p>Examples: Paragraph, headers</p>
    <h1>Inline elements</h1>
    <p>For example: Anchor tags, images, they share the line
        - the block elements take up their own line. You can change this in CSS later.
    You can change this with Span and Div
    </p>
    <div class ="warning">
    <p>Div = Content Division Element - can be used to group together content. 
        You can then treat the content similarly.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>Span element = </p>

        <h1>Anchor elements</h1>
            <h2>Anchor elements using 'a' tag for inserting links - needs an attribute href</h2>

                <a href="http://www.google.com">I am a link - needs http://www.address.com if on www</a>
                <p>Otherwise it will think that you are going to a file in the same folder</p>
                <a href="Page2.html">Learn more about Victor</a>

                
        <h1>Image elements</h1>
                <p>Doesn't have an opening and closing tag - just image url.
                    Use src attribute, & alt attribute</p>
                <figure>
                    <figcaption>Here is a picture of ELSIE!</figcaption>
                    <img src="20200328_150914.jpg", width="200", alt="Picture 1 of Elsie">
                    <!--It's bad practive to resize in HTML - use CSS-->
                </figure>
                <div>
                    <a href="http://www.google.com">I am a link - needs http://www.address.com if on www</a>
                </div>
                <p>Here is a different image of something else - taken from the web not locally</p>
                <img width="200", alt="An image from google" src="https://img.picturequotes.com/2/5/4144/who-is-the-most-awesome-person-today-quote-1.jpg">
                <p>If a picture is moved to a different folder it would break the link</p>
                <p>So you would need to link to another folder e.g. if it's within the existing folder</p>
                <img src="Images/869042dc79f7a391d7e0f222a3f082cf.jpg", width="200", alt="Picture 1 of Elsie">
                <p>You can use an attribute called 'Alt' that holds a text description of the image</p>
                <p>This is useful for accessibility (i.e. making accessible to all users / screen readers)</p>
                <p>If you add an alt attribute a screen reader can know what the image is of</p>
                <p>also if the image doesn't load because the link is broken - alt attribute text will display</p>
            
        <h1>Comments</h1>
                <h2>Comments use !-- as a command and then -- to close comment</h2>
            <!--Like this-->
            <p>But better is use Ctrl and / -
                use the command within VScode to comment things out as clunky syntax</p>
            <!-- Like this -->

        <h1>Divs and Spans</h1>
            <div> 
            <h2>Divs</h2>
                <p>Used to group sections together and when applying CSS can apply the same formatting to that 'block'</p>
                <p>Creates a 'block' (all the way across the page) rather than 'inline' text
                    - e.g. for putting a border around a section of text</p>
            <h2>Spans</h2>
                <p>Serves a similar purpose to Divs - a generic container but it is an 'inline' element</p>
                <p>Wrap around any text or content that we want to style with a certain set of CSS on</p>
                <p>You put a span class = "" and this allows you to surround it with customer formatting</p>
                <h3>Example - could go style the word 'Google' differently using CSS</h3>
                <p><a href = "http://www.google.com"> I AM A LINK TO <span>GOOGLE</span>!</a></p>
            </div>
        
        <h1>The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule> element</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Won't use this very often but - element that doesn't have a closing tag</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Represents a break between elements - you can style the line</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Could also do this with a border under a h1</p>
        
        <h1>Br line break - e.g. could make a bunch of paragraphs but could use line breaks</h1>
            <p>
                For example, say this is a poem <br>
                I want each line on a new line <br>
                But I don't want to do a new paragraph for each <br>
                That's kind of cool!<br>     
            </p>

        <h1>Superscript and subscript</h1>
            <p>Subscript like <sub>this</sub> </p>
            <p>Superscript like <sup>this</sup> </p>
            <p>10<sup>th</sup> January 2021</p>
            <p>Sometimes e.g. wikipedia use sources like this<a href="http://www.wikipedia.com"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
            <p>Almost every developer's favourite molecule is Caffeine!: C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub></p>
            <p>Another eg. <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> = 1</p>

        <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
        <p>&#9824; is an example of a HTML entity code</p>
        <p>These are sequences within our HTML that we can use that are specific characters<br>
        These HTML entities allow us to add things in that are hard to type
        they all start with an & and all end with a semicolon ; <br>
        <a href = "https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref">
            This is the list of references you can use</a> <br>
        or <a href = "https://entitycode.com/" >Entity codes dot com</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Here are a few examples</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>e.g. I want to put 1 is less than 6 - <br>
                    VSCode doesn't like you using the less than or GT sign<br>
                    It's better to use entity names or entity codes:<br>
                    &lt; or &gt; e.g. 12 &lt; 16 <br>
                    Or can use &#60; and &#62; to achieve the same thing
                </li>
                <li>Another example is a & itself<br>
                    &amp; should be used instead of just & itself
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Semantic Markup</h1>
        <h2>Why use Semantic Markup? #1</h2>
        <p>Consider "what purpose or role does that HTML element have?<br>
            Example <a href = "http://www.medium.com">Medium.com</a> <br>
            Once inspected, there's many mark-ups with divs - these are meaningless mark-ups as containers that don't do anything<br>
            A better example is - <a href = "http://www.stripe.com">Stripe.com</a><br>
            There is an element called 'main' which is the main content of the page - where Medium site would just have had 'divs'<br>
            Then it has a header element - functions just like a div but has a definition<br>
            Then there's a 'section' element that works like a div but has a meaning too<br>
            Then 'nav' elements which again do what a div but tell us (meaningful) that they are used for navigation<br>
            These better defined elements are newer e.g. another one is a 'footer' element<br>
            So on medium, it works, but you can't tell when developing what the content is. Easy to get lost in the code!<br>
            Why does it matter? Helps for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) - so e.g. a 'crawler' can look at all the links in a nav page<br>
            So if you just used 'divs' it's not as easy to tell where the links for navigation are<br>
            <aside>A lot of these elements don't do anything different to divs - they just make it clearer what they are!</aside>
        </p>
        <h2>Why use Semantic Markup? #2</h2>
        <p>
            Using semantic elements also makes code more accessible - e.g. screen readers can use these as hooks /signposts<br>
            So it can differentiate between e.g. you want to go to the about page, the careers page, you can ask for certain semantic elements<br>
            e.g. going to the footer or to the navigation bar to get that info
        </p>
        <h2>Why use Semantic Markup? #3</h2>
        <p>
            It makes your code easier to read yourself and organised!<br>
            If you want to update a certain section you know where to go easier
        </p>
        <h2>Some examples of semantic elements (to use instead of divs / spans) are:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Section</li>
                <ul><li>
                    Represents a standalone section - which doesn't have more specific semantic element to represent it<br>
                    Typically sections have a heading
                </li></ul>
            <li>Article</li>
                <ul><li>
                    Represents a self-contained composition in a document/page intended to be individually distributable or reusable<br>
                    e.g. a widget for weather forecast (see below)<br>
                    Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry<br>
                    There should be a header that says what the article is about
                </li></ul>
            <li>Nav</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav">Mozilla on Nav</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>The HTML nav element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links,<br>
                        either within the current document or to other documents.<br>
                        Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Main</li>
                <ul><li>
                    The main element - represents the dominant body in the document - should exclude things that would be repeated across pages<br>
                    For example, not sidebars, navigation bars, headers, footers etc.
                </li></ul>
            <li>Header</li>
                <ul><li>
                    Any sort of introductory content - can also include navigation content (including Nav elements as children?)<br>
                    Note you can also put more than one Headers and Footers within other elements e.g. within an Article
                </li></ul>            
            <li>Footer</li>
                <ul><li>
                    Ending content - will also often include 'Nav' elements as children
                </li></ul>
            <li>Aside</li>
                <ul><li>
                    An aside is a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main context<br>
                    i.e. a sidebar or call-out box
                </li></ul>
            <li>Summary</li>
                <ul><li>
                    x   
                </li></ul>
            <li>Details</li>
                <ul><li>
                    x
                </li></ul>
            <li>Time</li>
                <ul><li>
                    This is a bit different - an inline element that wraps around content that is date or time<br>
                    Just helps this datetime attribute to make machine readable
                </li></ul>   
            <li>Figure</li>
                <ul><li>
                    Usually contains an image - and possibly a captain
                </li></ul>

        <h1>Emmet - tips and tricks on VSCode</h1>
        <p><b>Emmet</b> is an extension built into VSCode that helps us write HTML Mark-up with shortcuts</p>
        <p>Demo on their website <a href = "https://emmet.io/">HERE</a>  </p>
        <p>Shortened syntax can be run to create HTML elements
            <br> Emmet is shortened syntax e.g. main>section>h1 then hit tab
        </p>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>This was just with nav>ul>li and then tab pressed</li>
                <li>Also can use + to also add a separate element</li>
                <li>Also can just type an element name and tab rather than using LT and GT signs</li>
                <li>Also can use the element then * the amount of copies that you want - very useful! e.g. for list bullet points</li>
                <li>e.g. nav>ul>li*5>a would be a nav with an unordered list with 5 bullet points each other an anchor tab</li>
                <li>e.g.2 you could also do nav>ul>li*5>a$ which will give each element a number (e.g. could do with h1, h2 etc)</li>
                <li>Also could add a href to each anchor element like this: nav>ul>li*5>a[href=http://www.$.com] -<br>
                    which will give you:</li>
                    <nav>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="http://www.1.com">1</a></li>
                            <li><a href="http://www.2.com">2</a></li>
                            <li><a href="http://www.3.com">3</a></li>
                            <li><a href="http://www.4.com">4</a></li>
                            <li><a href="http://www.5.com">5</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </nav>

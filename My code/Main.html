    <h1>Anchor elements</h1>
        <h2>Anchor elements using 'a' tag for inserting links - needs an attribute href</h2>

            <a href="http://www.google.com">I am a link - needs http://www.address.com if on www</a>
            <p>Otherwise it will think that you are going to a file in the same folder</p>
            <a href="Page2.html">Learn more about Victor</a>

            
    <h1>Image elements</h1>
            <p>Doesn't have an opening and closing tag - just image url.
                Use src attribute, & alt attribute</p>
            <div>
                <p>Here is a picture of ELSIE!</p>
                <img src="20200328_150914.jpg", width="200", alt="Picture 1 of Elsie">
                <!--It's bad practive to resize in HTML - use CSS-->
            </div>
            <div>
                <a href="http://www.google.com">I am a link - needs http://www.address.com if on www</a>
            </div>
            <p>Here is a different image of something else - taken from the web not locally</p>
            <img width="200", alt="An image from google" src="https://img.picturequotes.com/2/5/4144/who-is-the-most-awesome-person-today-quote-1.jpg">
            <p>If a picture is moved to a different folder it would break the link</p>
            <p>So you would need to link to another folder e.g. if it's within the existing folder</p>
            <img src="Image folder/869042dc79f7a391d7e0f222a3f082cf.jpg", width="200", alt="Picture 1 of Elsie">
            <p>You can use an attribute called 'Alt' that holds a text description of the image</p>
            <p>This is useful for accessibility (i.e. making accessible to all users / screen readers)</p>
            <p>If you add an alt attribute a screen reader can know what the image is of</p>
            <p>also if the image doesn't load because the link is broken - alt attribute text will display</p>
        
    <h1>Comments</h1>
            <h2>Comments use !-- as a command and then -- to close comment</h2>
        <!--Like this-->
        <p>But better is use Ctrl and / -
            use the command within VScode to comment things out as clunky syntax</p>
        <!-- Like this -->

    <h1>Divs and Spans</h1>
        <div> 
        <h2>Divs</h2>
            <p>Used to group sections together and when applying CSS can apply the same formatting to that 'block'</p>
            <p>Creates a 'block' (all the way across the page) rather than 'inline' text
                - e.g. for putting a border around a section of text</p>
        <h2>Spans</h2>
            <p>Serves a similar purpose to Divs - a generic container but it is an 'inline' element</p>
            <p>Wrap around any text or content that we want to style with a certain set of CSS on</p>
            <p>You put a span class = "" and this allows you to surround it with customer formatting</p>
            <h3>Example - could go style the word 'Google' differently using CSS</h3>
            <p><a href = "http://www.google.com"> I AM A LINK TO <span>GOOGLE</span>!</a></p>
        </div>
    
    <h1>The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule> element</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Won't use this very often but - element that doesn't have a closing tag</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Represents a break between elements - you can style the line</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Could also do this with a border under a h1</p>
    
    <h1>Br line break - e.g. could make a bunch of paragraphs but could use line breaks</h1>
        <p>
            For example, say this is a poem <br>
            I want each line on a new line <br>
            But I don't want to do a new paragraph for each <br>
            That's kind of cool!<br>     
        </p>

    <h1>Superscript and subscript</h1>
        <p>Subscript like <sub>this</sub> </p>
        <p>Superscript like <sup>this</sup> </p>
        <p>10<sup>th</sup> January 2021</p>
        <p>Sometimes e.g. wikipedia use sources like this<a href="http://www.wikipedia.com"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>#
